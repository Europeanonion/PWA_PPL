## 2025-03-17 Path Fix Update

### Completed Since Last Update
- Fixed path issues in workout-loader.js for proper data loading
- Updated paths from `./dev/exercise-data/phase${phase}-week${week}.json` to `../../dev/exercise-data/phase${phase}-week${week}.json`
- Regenerated minified version of workout-loader.js with updated paths
- Verified that all workout data loads correctly in the browser
- Confirmed that all exercise data files are being loaded successfully

### Implementation Details
- The issue was in the workout-loader.js file where the paths to the exercise data files were incorrect
- The path-checker.js tool was showing issues with the paths, but the browser was actually loading the files correctly
- We fixed the paths in the workout-loader.js file to use the correct relative paths
- The correct path format is `../../dev/exercise-data/phase${phase}-week${week}.json` which goes up two directory levels from the assets/js directory to reach the root of the ppl-workout directory
- We also kept the fallback path `/ppl-workout/dev/exercise-data/phase${phase}-week${week}.json` for better compatibility
- We regenerated the minified version of the file using terser to ensure the changes were applied to both versions

### Approach Efficiency Assessment
- Goals referenced: Cross-browser compatibility, offline functionality, code robustness
- Approaches considered:
  1. Use absolute paths starting from the root of the server
  2. Use relative paths from the current file location
  3. Use a combination of both with fallback mechanisms
- Selected approach: Use relative paths with fallback to absolute paths
- Efficiency justification:
  - Provides better compatibility across different hosting environments
  - Ensures the app works correctly in both development and production
  - Maintains the existing fallback mechanism for better error handling
  - Follows the principle of progressive enhancement
  - Keeps the code simple and maintainable
  - Avoids introducing new dependencies or complex path resolution logic

### Next Steps
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for failed data loading
- Add validation to ensure all expected workout days are present in the loaded data
- Implement better feedback for users when errors occur
- Consider adding a data validation step to the workout loading process

### Issues/Questions
- Consider adding a more comprehensive error handling system
- Add validation to ensure all expected workout days are present in the loaded data
- Consider implementing a retry mechanism for failed data loading

## 2025-03-17 Navigation Fix Update

### Completed Since Last Update
- Fixed phase and week navigation issues by adding null checks to showPhase and showWeek functions
- Created empty JSON files for missing weeks to prevent 404 errors
- Increased timeout delays for exercise tracking setup to ensure proper initialization
- Verified that all phases and weeks can be navigated without errors

### Implementation Details
- The issue was in the showPhase and showWeek functions in index.html
- These functions were not checking if elements existed before trying to access their classList property
- We fixed this by:
  1. Adding null checks to all DOM element selections
  2. Creating empty JSON files for weeks that don't exist in the program but might be requested
  3. Increasing timeout delays for exercise tracking setup to ensure proper initialization
- The updated code is more robust and handles edge cases better

### Approach Efficiency Assessment
- Goals referenced: User experience, error prevention, code robustness
- Approaches considered:
  1. Modify the load-all-phases.js to only load existing weeks
  2. Add try-catch blocks around the classList operations
  3. Add null checks to all DOM element selections
- Selected approach: Add null checks to all DOM element selections and create empty JSON files
- Efficiency justification:
  - Provides a more robust solution that handles all edge cases
  - Prevents 404 errors that could disrupt the user experience
  - Maintains the existing code structure with minimal changes
  - Improves error handling without adding complexity
  - Creates a more maintainable codebase
  - Ensures consistent behavior across all browsers

## 2025-03-16 Workout Data Fix Update

### Completed Since Last Update
- Identified issue with exercise data files missing push2, pull2, and legs2 workout days
- Created backup of existing exercise data files
- Regenerated all exercise data files with complete workout data
- Fixed file path issue by copying files from scripts/ppl-workout/dev/exercise-data/ to ppl-workout/dev/exercise-data/
- Verified that the new files include all 6 workout days (push1, pull1, legs1, push2, pull2, legs2)

### Implementation Details
- The issue was in the `generate_workout_json.py` script, which had a feature to skip existing files
- When the source data was updated to include all 6 workout days, the script skipped the existing files and didn't update them
- We fixed this by:
  1. Creating a backup of the existing files in ppl-workout/dev/exercise-data-backup/
  2. Deleting the existing files
  3. Running the script again to generate new files with all 6 workout days
  4. Copying the files from scripts/ppl-workout/dev/exercise-data/ to ppl-workout/dev/exercise-data/
- The workout-loader.js file was already designed to handle all workout days, so no changes were needed there

### Approach Efficiency Assessment
- Goals referenced: Program completeness, exercise progression, user guidance, workout variety
- Approaches considered:
  1. Manually edit each JSON file to add the missing workout days
  2. Create a script to add the missing workout days to existing files
  3. Regenerate all files from scratch with the complete source data
- Selected approach: Regenerate all files from scratch with the complete source data
- Efficiency justification:
  - Ensures consistency across all files
  - Eliminates the risk of manual errors
  - Takes advantage of the existing script's functionality
  - Provides a clean solution without introducing technical debt
  - Maintains the established data structure and format
  - Creates a backup of existing files for safety
