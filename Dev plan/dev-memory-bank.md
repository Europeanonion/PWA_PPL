## 2025-03-16 Development Update

### Completed Since Last Update
- Created Python script to automate JSON workout file generation
- Generated all remaining workout JSON files for all phases
- Implemented error handling for missing data in source files
- Added proper structure for exercise data including substitutions

### Current Status
- Working on: Phase 1, Week 5 and remaining workout data files
- Completed: 
  - Phase 1, Weeks 1-6 exercise data
  - Phase 2, Weeks 1-4 exercise data
  - Phase 3, Weeks 1-3 exercise data
- Pending: 
  - Adding exercise links to all generated files
  - Implementing localStorage functionality
  - Creating progress tracking visualization
- Progress on milestones: 
  - Core Structure Complete: ‚úÖ
  - Phase 1 Content Complete: ‚úÖ
  - All Phases Content Complete: ‚úÖ (based on available data)
  - Local Storage MVP: üîÑ In progress
  - Enhanced Local Features: üîÑ In progress
  - Cloud Integration: ‚è≥ Not started

### Implementation Details
- Created a Python script to automate the generation of workout JSON files
- Script transforms data from the source format to the app's required format
- Added error handling to skip weeks that don't exist in the source data
- Implemented consistent ID generation for exercises using kebab-case
- Formatted rest times to be more concise (e.g., "~2 min" ‚Üí "2m")
- Created proper structure for substitutions as arrays

### Approach Efficiency Assessment
- Goals referenced: Minimize development time, maintain quality, ensure consistency
- Approaches considered:
  1. Continue manual creation of each JSON file
  2. Create a template file and use search_and_replace
  3. Write a Python script to automate the process
- Selected approach: Python script automation
- Efficiency justification: 
  - Reduced development time from hours to seconds
  - Eliminated human error in data transformation
  - Ensured consistent formatting across all files
  - Made the process repeatable if source data changes
  - Added proper error handling for missing data

### Next Steps
- Add exercise links to all generated files
- Implement localStorage functionality for tracking weights and completed sets
- Create progress visualization for completed workouts
- Add export/import functionality for user data

### Issues/Questions
- Some weeks are missing from the source data (Phase 2 weeks 5-6, Phase 3 weeks 4-6)
- Need to decide how to handle missing weeks in the UI
- Consider adding a way for users to create custom workouts for missing weeks
