PWA Icon Requirements

The following icon files need to be created and placed in this directory:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
   - Used for app icons on Android devices
   - Used as the apple-touch-icon for iOS devices

2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)
   - Used for app icons on Android devices
   - Required for PWA installation

3. maskable-icon.png (512x512 pixels)
   - Should have padding around the main content (safe zone)
   - Used for adaptive icons on Android

Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use the app's primary color (#C38803) as the background
- Include a simple dumbbell or weight icon in white
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- For the maskable icon, ensure the main content is within the inner 80% of the image

These placeholder files should be replaced with actual PNG images before deploying the app.
