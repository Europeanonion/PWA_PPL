# Push-Pull-Legs Workout App Development Plan

Based on our analysis of the current state and Excel content, here's a revised plan to develop the Push-Pull-Legs workout tracking app:

## Phase 1: Complete the HTML App Core (1-2 weeks)

### 1. Fix HTML Structure Issues (Priority: HIGH)
- **Fix orphaned table rows** - Currently there are several table rows at the bottom of the document that need proper placement
- **Create consistent structure** for all workout days
- **Implement proper navigation** between phases and weeks
- **Add collapsible notes and substitutions** for all exercises

### 2. Complete Phase 1, Week 1 Content (Priority: HIGH)
- **Push Day 1 & 2**: Complete all exercises, including:
  - Barbell/dumbbell press variations
  - Overhead press movements
  - Tricep isolation exercises
  - Rest/rep/RPE guidance
- **Pull Day 1 & 2**: Complete all exercises, including:
  - Vertical pulling movements (pulldowns, pull-ups)
  - Horizontal rows
  - Bicep and rear delt work
- **Legs Day 1 & 2**: Complete all exercises, including:
  - Squat variations
  - Deadlift variations
  - Isolation work for quads, hamstrings, calves
  
### 3. Add Exercise Resources (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Find and link to **demonstration videos** (YouTube preferred)
- Add **comprehensive form notes** for each exercise
- Include **2-3 substitution options** for each exercise

## Phase 2: Add LocalStorage Implementation (1 week)

### 1. Create Data Structure (Priority: HIGH)
```javascript
// Core storage structure
const workoutData = {
  "settings": { "units": "lbs", "darkMode": false },
  "currentPhase": 1,
  "currentWeek": 1,
  "progress": {
    "phase1": {
      "week1": {
        "push1": {
          "date": "2025-03-16",
          "exercises": {
            "benchPress": {
              "sets": [
                {"weight": 135, "reps": 8, "completed": true},
                {"weight": 155, "reps": 6, "completed": true}
              ],
              "notes": "Felt strong today"
            }
            // Additional exercises
          }
        }
        // Other workout days
      }
      // Other weeks
    }
    // Other phases
  },
  "personalRecords": { /* Exercise PRs */ }
};
```

### 2. Add UI Elements for Tracking (Priority: HIGH)
- **Input fields** for tracking weight used for each set
- **Rep counters** for recording actual reps completed
- **Checkboxes** for marking sets as complete
- **Personal notes field** for each exercise

### 3. Implement Storage Functions (Priority: HIGH)
- Functions to **save workout progress**
- **Auto-save** on input changes
- Functions to **load previous workout data**
- **Personal record tracking and notifications**

### 4. Add Data Management Features (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Export** workout data as JSON
- **Import** previously saved data
- **Clear progress** with confirmation

## Phase 3: Complete Workout Content (Ongoing)

### 1. Build Out All Phases (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Phase 1**: Weeks 2-6
- **Phase 2**: Weeks 1-6
- **Phase 3**: Weeks 1-6

### 2. Use Manual Content Creation (Priority: HIGH)
- Manually create workout content rather than relying on Excel parsing
- Follow consistent pattern for exercise progression
- Document all exercise variations and programming logic

### 3. PWA Implementation (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Add **manifest.json** for PWA capabilities
- Implement **service worker** for offline functionality
- Add "**Add to Home Screen**" prompt
- Test across multiple devices and browsers

## Implementation Notes

### Key Findings from Analysis
1. The Excel automation approach wasn't successful in parsing the workout data
2. The current HTML has good structure but some orphaned elements need fixing
3. Manual content creation will be more reliable than automated parsing
4. Focus on completing Phase 1, Week 1 first to establish proper patterns

### LocalStorage vs. Cloud Storage
- **LocalStorage** is the priority implementation for data persistence
- Simpler implementation with no server requirements
- Data remains private to the user's device
- ~5MB storage limit is sufficient for workout tracking

### Recommended Implementation Path
1. **Start with fixing HTML** and completing basic structure
2. **Add one complete workout day** with all features as a template
3. **Implement LocalStorage** for that workout day
4. **Replicate the pattern** for remaining workout days

### Code Structure Approach
- Keep all code in a single HTML file for simplicity
- Use clear commenting to separate sections
- Implement proper namespacing for JavaScript functions
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
