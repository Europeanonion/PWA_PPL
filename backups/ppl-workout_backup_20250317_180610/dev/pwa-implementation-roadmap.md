   - Test manifest properties

3. Execute comprehensive tests:
   - Test on all target devices and browsers
   - Test under various network conditions
   - Test performance metrics
   - Test UI/UX across different screen sizes

4. Document and fix issues:
   - Prioritize issues by severity
   - Fix critical and high-priority issues
   - Document workarounds for lower-priority issues
   - Verify fixes with retesting

### Resources

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Tasks | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1. PWA Icon Set Completion | Create icons, update manifest | 1-2 days | None |
| 2. Performance Optimization | Audit, optimize, minify | 2-3 days | Phase 1 |
| 3. Installation Experience | Enhance install UI, create guides | 2-3 days | Phase 1 |
| 4. Comprehensive Testing | Test across platforms and conditions | 3-4 days | Phases 1-3 |
| 5. Final Polishing | Final audits, documentation | 1-2 days | Phase 4 |

**Total Estimated Time: 9-14 days**

## Task Assignments

For each phase, the following roles are recommended:

- **Developer**: Implement technical changes, write code, fix issues
- **Designer**: Create visual assets, design UI components
- **Tester**: Execute test cases, document issues, verify fixes
- **Documentation**: Create and update documentation

For a solo developer, these roles would be performed sequentially within each phase.

## Success Criteria

The PWA implementation will be considered complete when:

1. **Installation**: The app can be installed on Android, iOS, and desktop platforms
2. **Offline**: The app functions fully offline after initial load
3. **Performance**: Lighthouse PWA score is 90+ and Performance score is 80+
4. **Cross-platform**: The app works consistently across all target platforms
5. **Documentation**: Complete documentation is available for users and developers

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After implementation, the following ongoing activities are recommended:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly audit performance metrics
2. **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user feedback
3. **Browser Updates**: Test with new browser versions
4. **Feature Enhancements**: Implement prioritized enhancements from the backlog

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to completing the PWA implementation for the Ultimate Push-Pull-Legs Workout Tracker. By following this plan, the development team can ensure a high-quality PWA that provides an excellent user experience across all platforms and network conditions.

The implementation is divided into manageable phases with clear dependencies and priorities. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring that the most critical components are implemented first and that the final product meets all the requirements for a modern, high-performance PWA.
